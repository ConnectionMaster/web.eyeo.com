<span>Who we are</span> {#whoweare .heading}
=================================

With the help of an international community of volunteers, we develop open source software that millions of people use every day to have a better online experience. Our solutions such as [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/), which, with over 500 million downloads, is the most popular add-on/extension ever, put users in control over the kind of content they see online. Beyond that, we build software that encourages positive, informative advertising and privacy protection practices.

We are an international team, about half of whom work in the main Cologne office or in our shiny new Berlin office, and the other half remotely. eyeo was founded in 2011, when Till Faida met Wladimir Palant; and the two decided to take Palantâ€™s sometimes hobby, Adblock Plus, and try and change a billion-dollar industry with it.
