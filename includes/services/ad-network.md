Want to work with us hand-in-hand to develop the advertising landscape of the future? Join the Acceptable Ads program and add your ads to the whitelist. Working to develop non-intrusive ads for users that are a choosy, tech-savvy audience is the long-term benefit.

Ad networks can become a member of our Acceptable Ads program, and get their Acceptable Ads certified. 

Among other things we can help you define standard design templates for your advertisers in the first step. Then we assist you in setting up the technical environment necessary for working with multiple publishers and hundreds of websites.

[Please contact us](https://eyeo.com/en/contact) if you want to learn more.

Keep in mind that we will check your ads against the [Acceptable Ads criteria](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#criteria). These criteria were developed with our users, and in order to participate in Acceptable Ads the ads in question must be in line with them. During your application we will also mutually determine the level of required support services.
