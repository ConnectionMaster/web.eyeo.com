Most users who have Acceptable Ads enabled are willing to accept advertising that adheres to the Acceptable Ads guidelines. We can help you design ads for this specific target audience.

â€‹[Please contact us](https://eyeo.com/en/contact) if you want to learn more.

Keep in mind that we will check your ads against the [Acceptable Ads criteria](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#criteria). These criteria were developed with our users, and in order to participate in Acceptable Ads the ads in question must be in line with them. During your application we will also mutually determine the level of required support services.
