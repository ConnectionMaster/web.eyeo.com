### Grow

eyeo encourages both personal and professional development, which is why we cover conference visits, contribute to your (relevant) education costs and let you decide on your own hardware / software.

### Work / life balance

It's important to us that you're happy and energized, so we offer flexible working hours, 26 days of vacation and host regular events in our offices and virtually so everyone can connect.

### Family first

We understand the importance of family. We contribute towards childcare costs and offer 4 months maternity leave.

### Travel

We cover the cost of your transport if you live in Cologne or Berlin. If youâ€™re abroad, we will cover the costs for your trip to Cologne twice a year for our office parties!
