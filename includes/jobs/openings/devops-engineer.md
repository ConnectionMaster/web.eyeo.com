Literally everything we do is [open source](https://hg.adblockplus.org). Anyone can contribute. If you join Eyeo, you can do it for a living.

As a DevOps engineer, you will help make Adblock Plus scale as it gains millions of users every month, by making our infrastructure more flexible and efficient.

In addition, you will have the opportunity to help move our development infrastructure towards continuous integration, and generally more automation. You can also work upstream on related open source projects, like Puppet.

Most of our developers work remotely, so can you. If you'd prefer an office environment, we'll help you relocate to Cologne, or pay for a coworking space.

**Requirements**

- Strong experience with Linux server environments
- Experience with configuration management, preferably Puppet
- Very good knowledge of how the web works
- Very good communication skills in English
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity
- Experience with Python would be a big plus

Not sure if this is for you? Consider [contributing](https://adblockplus.org/en/contribute-code) first.

When applying, please include a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you worked on.
