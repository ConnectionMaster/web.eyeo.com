Literally everything we do is [open source](https://hg.adblockplus.org). Anyone can contribute. If you join Eyeo, you can do it for a living.

As a web developer, you would make Adblock Plus easier to use, more effective and more efficient. Or you could work on our websites, web applications or backend services.

What you work on is up to you, there is a lot to do and many ways you could contribute. You can also work upstream on related projects, like Firefox or Chromium.

Almost all developers work remotely, so can you. If you'd prefer an office environment, we'll help you relocate to Cologne, or pay for a coworking space.

**Requirements**

- Strong experience with web technologies, in particular JavaScript
- Good knowledge of how the web works
- Very good communication skills in English
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity
- Experience with browser extension development or Python would be a plus

Not sure if this is for you? Consider [contributing](https://adblockplus.org/en/contribute-code) first.

When applying, please include a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you worked on.
