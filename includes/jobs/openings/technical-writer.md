We're looking for an experienced technical writer who can improve and unify the texts and documentation of our products and websites.

You would be responsible for establishing a language style guide and making sure it is used consistently. We currently have some outdated information published that you would have to track down, along with ensuring the necessary changes are implemented timely in future.

In addition, you would manage all our translations, which are largely produced by volunteer translators via Crowdin. You would make sure the translators get the information required to produce good translations, and appoint volunteers with a good track record as proofreaders for their respective languages.

Many of us work remotely, so can you. If you'd prefer an office environment, we'll help you relocate to Cologne, or pay for a coworking space.

**Requirements**

- Experience as a technical writer
- Experience editing texts
- Excellent English language skills (ILR level 5)
- Good communication skills
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity
- Experience with translations would be a big plus
- Knowledge of languages other than English would be a plus
- Understanding of the software and web development process would be a plus

When applying, please include some texts you've written.
