Literally everything we do is [open source](https://hg.adblockplus.org). Anyone can contribute. If you join Eyeo, you can do it for a living.

We're looking for someone who can help bring Adblock Plus to mobile devices and other resource constrained environments.

You will help maintain and improve [libadblockplus](https://hg.adblockplus.org/libadblockplus), our cross-platform library that brings ad blocking to native applications, and develop applications based on it. You can also work upstream on related open source projects, like Firefox, Chromium or V8.

Most of our developers work remotely, so can you. If you'd prefer an office environment, we'll help you relocate to Cologne, or pay for a coworking space.

**Requirements**

- Experience developing modern C++ applications
- Experience with Android or iOS
- Good knowledge of network protocols, in particular HTTP(S)
- Very good communication skills in English
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity
- Experience working on Chromium, or other browsers, would be a big plus
- Experience with Linux systems programming, V8, JavaScript or Python would be a plus

Not sure if this is for you? Consider [contributing](https://adblockplus.org/en/contribute-code) first.

When applying, please include a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you worked on.
