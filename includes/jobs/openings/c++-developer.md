Literally everything we do is [open source](https://hg.adblockplus.org). Anyone can contribute. If you join Eyeo, you can do it for a living.

As a C++ developer, you will help make Adblock Plus for Internet Explorer as powerful and popular as our other browser extensions. Building Internet Explorer extensions is an act of systems programming, making it much more challenging.

We will have more native projects over time, and you will have the opportunity to work on those, as well as any of our other projects if you enjoy variety. You can also work upstream on related open source projects, like Firefox, Chromium or V8.

Almost all developers work remotely, so can you. If you'd prefer an office environment, we'll help you relocate to Cologne, or pay for a coworking space.

**Requirements**

- Experience developing modern C++ applications
- Experience with systems programming on Windows or Linux
- Good knowledge of how the web works
- Very good communication skills in English
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity
- Experience with V8, JavaScript, Python, Android or iOS would be a plus

Not sure if this is for you? Consider [contributing](https://adblockplus.org/en/contribute-code) first.

When applying, please include a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you worked on.
