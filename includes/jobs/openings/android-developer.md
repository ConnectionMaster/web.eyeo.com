Literally everything we do is [open source](https://hg.adblockplus.org). Anyone can contribute. If you join Eyeo, you can do it for a living.

As an Android developer, you will help make Adblock Plus for Android as powerful and easy to use as our browser extensions. That's challenging, and requires creativity and deep Android knowledge.

We have more than one option, and we will build apps trying some others over time. You will also have the opportunity to work on any of our other projects, if you enjoy variety, and you can work upstream on related projects, like Android itself.

Almost all developers work remotely, so can you. If you'd prefer an office environment, we'll help you relocate to Cologne, or pay for a coworking space.

**Requirements**

- Experience developing Android applications
- Very good knowledge of how the web works
- Very good communication skills in English
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity
- Experience with iOS development would be a plus
- Experience with JavaScript or C++ would be a big plus

Not sure if this is for you? Consider [contributing](https://adblockplus.org/en/contribute-code) first.

When applying, please include a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you worked on.
