### Cologne (Köln)

Our Cologne office is part of the Leitrad Lofts, a brand new building located in the trendy and alternative Cologne-Ehrenfeld, a multi-cultural district that is a major center for innovative and creative companies. Our laid-back space fosters creativity, encourages productivity and reflects who we are.

When we’re not working, we enjoy cooking in our state-of-the-art kitchen and enjoying good conversation (and maybe a drink or two) on our rooftop terrace.

### Berlin

We are located in the heart of historic Berlin, one of Europe’s most innovative startup hubs. Life in this vibrant city is never dull and there are a million things to do and explore outside of work. Join our fast growing team here to see what the fuss is all about!

### Malmö

As the 4th most international city in the world with 177 nationalities (only beat by New York, London and Washington) and the 3rd largest city in Sweden, Malmö is an inviting place to live. It is a city with a vibrant startup community and the best climate (both weather and cultural) in Sweden. In Malmö we live a bit slower than the rest of Sweden; maybe it’s because we are a short bike ride from one of many city beaches or a 30-minute train ride from laid-back Copenhagen.

We're located in the [House of Ada](https://houseofada.se) in the center of Malmö.
