**When was Adblock Plus written?**

Wladimir Palant wrote the original Adblock Plus in 2006.

**What happened between 2006 and founding Eyeo in 2011?**

In that time Wladimir’s Adblock Plus became the most popular extension ever.

Then in 2011 he met Till Faida, whose background was in online marketing. They started talking about collaborating, because they both felt that online advertising was broken. Coming at the issue with completely different backgrounds, they started looking for a middle ground. Their solution became the [Acceptable Ads initiative](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads), and they founded Eyeo out of a necessity to have a legal business entity for support and to develop additional products that give users control over their online experience.

**What is Eyeo’s relationship with Adblock Plus?**

The product "Adblock Plus" is owned and operated by Eyeo GmbH (a GmbH is the German equivalent to a Ltd./Inc.). Eyeo also owns the rights to Adblock Plus and all associated names and trademarks. 

**What is the nature of Eyeo’s business?**

Till Faida and Wladimir Palant founded Eyeo GmbH and the Acceptable Ads initiative to create a sustainable middle ground for online advertisements that is beneficial to both user and advertiser. To take part in the initiative, websites have to conform to strict guidelines. Once they have, ads on their sites are whitelisted. Whitelisting is free for small and medium websites and blogs. To make the initiative sustainable, larger properties that have gone through the same whitelisting process as all other ones are charged a fee. We are in the process of developing new products in line with our essential mission (LINK word “mission” to homepage and mission statement).

**Can Adblock Plus users still block all ads, even those that have been whitelisted?**

Yes, users can [opt out](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#optout) in just a few clicks. Users can also whitelist sites that they personally want to support.

**I want to be a part of the community &#8212; how do I do that?**

Simply sign up for our forum [here](https://adblockplus.org/forum/)! (Click Register in the upper-right portion.)

**How many employees do you have?**

<p><? include size-of-team ?></p>

**What is the process for being whitelisted?**

To be whitelisted, a website or advertiser must [apply](https://eyeo.com/acceptable-ads-application.html). At that point we collaborate with them to bring their ads in line with the [criteria of our Acceptable Ads initiative](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#criteria). After that, we send the proposed ads to our 27,000-plus community for 7 – 10 days for an open discussion. If members of the community raise legitimate objections about proposed ads, we go back to the drawing board with the website or advertiser. If nothing comes up we whitelist the ads after the time period discussed above. All whitelisted sites are available [here](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/exceptionrules.txt).

**Why do some companies pay to be whitelisted and others do not?**

Whitelisting is free for all small websites and blogs. However, managing this list requires significant effort on our side and this task cannot be completely taken over by volunteers as it happens with common filter lists. That’s why we are being paid by some larger properties that serve nonintrusive advertisements that want to participate in the Acceptable Ads initiative.

**Can companies pay to be on the whitelist?**

Absolutely not. Anyone and everyone can apply to be whitelisted. Whether they are or not depends solely on the content of their advertisements, i.e., whether they conform to our unambiguous Acceptable Ads criteria. However, after approval, some larger properties that serve nonintrusive advertisements pay.
