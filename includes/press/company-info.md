In January 2006 Wladimir Palant wrote Adblock Plus. Less than a year later Adblock Plus was the most downloaded Firefox add-on, a position it has retained ever since. In addition to Firefox, the extension is now available for Google Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer and Android.

Meanwhile, Till Faida was studying international business and management in the Netherlands and Sweden. Intrigued by what Wladimir was doing with Adblock Plus, Till decided to make it the subject of his thesis. Wladimir and Till met one another through Tim Schumacher, founder of Sedo GmbH and an investor who had taken an interest in developing Adblock Plus with Wladimir. Eventually, with Tim on as an investor and adviser, Wladimir and Till decided to start Eyeo GmbH to be the business side of Adblock Plus.

Eyeo features a host of products associated with Adblock Plus, all of which are geared toward giving users more control and more information about their online experience. The company would like to develop other products which adhere to the principles upon which Wladimir and Till founded the company: making the Internet a better place through content choice, user control, privacy and security. Eyeo GmbH is located in Cologne, and currently employs <? include size-of-team ?> people.
