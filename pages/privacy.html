    What is personal data?
  </h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of data protection is to protect personal data. Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (<strong>"data subject"</strong>). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. This information includes, for example, details such as name, postal address, email address or telephone number, but also nicknames, certificates and information about your interests.

  <h3 id="the-legal-basis">
      What is the legal basis?
  </h3>
  <p>
      We process personal data in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu">Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> (<strong>GDPR</strong>) and the applicable German national data protection laws.
  </p>
  <h4>
      Processing is necessary for taking steps prior to enter into a contract (Art. 6 (1) b GDPR)
  </h4>
  <p>
      All data you provide us in connection to your application (more information can be found in the <a href="#app-data">App data</a> section) is necessary for the sole purpose of hiring new employees and therefore evaluating and selecting applicants including, for example, setting up and conducting interviews and tests, evaluating and assessing the results thereto, and as otherwise needed in the recruitment processes including the final recruitment (meaning taking steps prior to enter into an employment contract). If you don’t send us your application data, your application cannot be taken into account.
  </p>
  <h4>
      Collection and processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject – Art. 6 (1) c GDPR
  </h4>
  <p>
      Collection and processing of your personal data may be necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject under EU laws or the laws of a EU Member State.
  </p>
  <h4 id="legitimate-interest">
      Processing is necessary for the purposes of eyeo’s legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) f GDPR)
  </h4>
  <p>
      The collection and processing may be necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. We collect and process website logs for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, preventing denial of service attacks. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with unnecessary requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. Preventing such overloads of our systems and any security issues by denial of service attacks is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use the website logs.
  </p>
  <p>
      We use website log data (with anonymized IP address) and language preferences from our web analytics tool for analyzing purposes to help us improve our website.
  </p>
  <h4>
      Processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 (1) a GDPR)
  </h4>
  <p>
      When subscribing to our newsletter (<a href="#newsletter">more information on our newsletter</a>), you provide us with your consent, which legitimizes the use of your email address in accordance and to the extent of your consent.
