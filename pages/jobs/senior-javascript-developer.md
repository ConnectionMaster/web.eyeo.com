Literally everything we do is [open source](https://hg.adblockplus.org). Anyone can contribute. If you join Eyeo, you can do it for a living.

We are looking for a senior developer with a solid understanding of computer science and a focus on web technologies, in particular JavaScript.

We have a particularly high interest in people who can work on the core code that powers Adblock Plus on all platforms. But you can also work on other parts of our stack, or upstream on related open source projects like Firefox or Chromium.

Most of our developers work remotely, so can you. If you'd prefer an office environment, we'll help you relocate to Cologne, or pay for a coworking space.

**Requirements**

- Strong experience with JavaScript, beyond frameworks like jQuery
- Solid understanding of algorithms and data structures
- Very good knowledge of how the web works
- Very good communication skills in English
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity
- Experience with browser extension development would be a big plus
- Knowledge of browser internals would be a big plus

Not sure if this is for you? Consider [contributing](https://adblockplus.org/en/contribute-code) first.

When applying, please include a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you worked on.
