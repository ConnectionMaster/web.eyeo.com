Literally everything we do is [open source](https://hg.adblockplus.org). Anyone can contribute. If you join Eyeo, you can do it for a living.

As an Android developer, you will help make Adblock Plus for Android as powerful and easy to use as our browser extensions. That's challenging, and requires creativity.

You will also have the opportunity to work on any of our other projects, and you can work upstream on related open source projects, like AOSP.

Most of our developers work remotely, so can you. If you'd prefer an office environment, we'll help you relocate to Cologne, or pay for a coworking space.

**Requirements**

- Experience developing Android applications
- Experience with C++
- Very good knowledge of how the web works
- Very good communication skills in English
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity
- Experience with JavaScript would be a big plus
- Experience with iOS development would be a plus

Not sure if this is for you? Consider [contributing](https://adblockplus.org/en/contribute-code) first.

When applying, please include a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you worked on.
