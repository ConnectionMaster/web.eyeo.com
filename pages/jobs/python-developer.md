Literally everything we do is [open source](https://hg.adblockplus.org). Anyone can contribute. If you join Eyeo, you can do it for a living. Eyeo is an equal opportunity employer, and encourages people of all genders, ethnicities, national origins, orientations, etc., to apply.

We're looking for an experienced Python developer to work on, and eventually become responsible for, our [backend code](https://hg.adblockplus.org/sitescripts) and development tools such as our [extension build system](https://hg.adblockplus.org/buildtools) and [static page generator](https://hg.adblockplus.org/cms). 

Your code will be an essential part in the stack that powers Adblock Plus, the most popular browser extension in the world, used by millions of users. In addition, you could contribute to any area of our code base you're interested in, or to related open source projects such as Python itself.

Most of our developers work remotely, so can you. If you'd prefer an office environment, we'll help you relocate to Cologne, or pay for a coworking space in your vicinity.

**Requirements**

- Strong experience with Python
- Experience with development for the UNIX platform
- Experience with building plain WSGI web applications
- Experience with processing large amounts of data, efficiently
- Experience with REST and other web APIs
- Solid understanding of how the web works
- Good communication skills in English
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity
- Experience with configuration management systems, in particular Puppet, would be a plus

When applying, please include a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you worked on.
