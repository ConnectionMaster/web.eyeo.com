Literally everything we do is [open source](https://hg.adblockplus.org). Anyone can contribute. If you join Eyeo, you can do it for a living.

We're looking for a senior web developer who can take charge of our websites, such as [adblockplus.org](https://adblockplus.org) and [acceptableads.org](https://acceptableads.org).

You would work with our developers and user experience designers to make our websites easier to use, easier to change and more efficient. You would work with our growth hackers and PR to build websites that promote Adblock Plus in creative, non-intrusive ways.

And if you feel like it, you can work on any of our other projects, or upstream on related open source projects.

**Requirements**

- Strong experience with modern HTML and CSS
- Experience with Python
- Experience with JavaScript, beyond frameworks like jQuery
- Experience with building and maintaining high traffic websites
- Experience with search engine optimization
- Solid understanding of how the web works
- Excellent communication skills in English
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity

Not sure if this is for you? Consider [contributing](https://adblockplus.org/en/contribute-code) first.

When applying, please include a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you worked on.
