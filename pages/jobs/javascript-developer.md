Literally everything we do is [open source](https://hg.adblockplus.org). Anyone can contribute. If you join Eyeo, you can do it for a living. Eyeo is an equal opportunity employer, and encourages people of all genders, ethnicities, national origins, orientations, etc., to apply.

We are looking for an experienced developer with a solid understanding of computer science and a focus on web technologies, in particular JavaScript.

You would work on our core ad blocking code, ensuring that ads are blocked as effectively and efficiently as possible. You would also work on the Adblock Plus browser extensions for Firefox, Chromium and Safari, which bring this code to millions of users. In addition, you could contribute to any area of our code base you're interested in, or to related open source projects such as Chromium or Firefox.

Most of our developers work remotely, so can you. If you'd prefer an office environment, we'll help you relocate to Cologne or Berlin, or pay for a coworking space in your vicinity.

**What we are expecting**

- Strong experience with JavaScript
- Deep knowledge of the DOM and modern browser APIs
- Solid understanding of algorithms and data structures
- Very good knowledge of how the web works
- Good communication skills in English
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity
- Knowledge of browser internals would be a big plus
- Experience with browser extension development would be a big plus

When applying, please include a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you worked on.
