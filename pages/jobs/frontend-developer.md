Literally everything we do is [open source](https://hg.adblockplus.org). Anyone can contribute. If you join Eyeo, you can do it for a living. Eyeo is an equal opportunity employer, and encourages people of all genders, ethnicities, national origins, orientations, etc., to apply.

We're looking for an experienced frontend developer who can work on our websites, such as [adblockplus.org](https://adblockplus.org), [acceptableads.org](https://acceptableads.org), [adblockbrowser.org](https://adblockbrowser.org) or [eyeo.com](https://eyeo.com).

You would work with our developers and user experience designers to make our websites easier to use, easier to change and more efficient. You would work with our growth and communications team to build websites that promote Adblock Plus in creative, non-intrusive ways. And if you feel like it, you can work on any of our other projects, or upstream on related open source projects.

Most of our developers work remotely, so can you. If you'd prefer an office environment, we'll help you relocate to Cologne, or pay for a coworking space in your vicinity.

**Requirements**

- Strong experience with JavaScript
- Strong experience with modern HTML and CSS
- Knowledge of the DOM and modern browser APIs
- Experience with building and maintaining high traffic websites
- Solid understanding of how the web works
- Excellent communication skills in English
- Ability to work and learn independently
- High integrity
- Experience with Python would be a plus
- Experience with search engine optimization would be a plus

When applying, please include a code sample or, preferably, references to open source projects you worked on.
