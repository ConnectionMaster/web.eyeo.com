**About you**

You are an expert designer who loves to solve big problems, advocates for the user, and cares about the little details. Other people find you easy to work with, thoughtful, and passionate about the things that really matter. Those you have worked with in the past would describe you as self-motivated and driven by results. 
And while you could build an interactive prototype in a matter of days, youâ€™d prefer first to spend your time thinking about the users, the problems they might have, and how we can solve them elegantly.
You also daydream of working at disruptive startup with super-smart people from all around the world, 
and sincerely want to help make the Open Web better for everybody.
