Annoyed by the icon? Please read this: https://adblockplus.org/en/android-faq#icon
Adblock Plus is an open-source, community driven project. Many volunteers are contributing to the development and maintenance of Adblock Plus. Currently, there are over forty continuously updating filter lists in over a dozen different languages, ensuring that all obtrusive ads remain blocked.
Please note that Adblock Plus will probably become the highest data-using application on your Android device. However, this is only because Adblock Plus needs to filter the data to ensure that the ads can be blocked. Adblock Plus is actually only using a fraction of the data shown on your device.
Adblock Plus is also available for Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari and Internet Explorer.</Char_Desc_2000>
